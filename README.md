# bielliptic
Code to accompany the paper "Computing points on bielliptic modular curves over fixed quadratic fields" by Philippe Michaud-Jacobs.

The paper is available on arXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/.

The repository contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- bielliptic_models.m provides code for computing suitable models for X_0(N) and checking nonsingularity,
- bielliptic_sieve.m contains an implementation of the Mordellâ€“Weil sieve used,
- bielliptic_sieve_output.txt contains the output of the bielliptic_sieve.m file
